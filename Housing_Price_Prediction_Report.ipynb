    "## 1. Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:  \n",
    "Feature engineering is crucial to enhance the predictive power of the model. This step improves the dataset by creating new features, handling missing data, and mitigating the impact of skewed data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Data**:\n",
    "  - Numerical features with missing values are imputed using the median.\n",
    "  - Categorical features with missing values are filled with the mode (most frequent value).  \n",
    "  **Why**: Imputation ensures the dataset remains complete and usable for model training, preventing loss of valuable data due to missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding New Features**:\n",
    "  - **Total Area**: Combines `Living_Area` and `Surface_area_plot_of_land`.\n",
    "  - **Total Amenities**: Counts the presence of amenities like a kitchen, terrace, swimming pool.\n",
    "  - **Average Room Size**: Calculated as `Living_Area / Number_of_Rooms`.\n",
    "  - **Amenities Ratio**: Ratio of amenities to rooms.  \n",
    "  **Why**: These new features help provide a more detailed view of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Transformation**:  \n",
    "  - Applied to `Living_Area`, `Total_Area`, and `total_income`.  \n",
    "  **Why**: Log transformations help reduce skewness, making the model better able to capture relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering Regions**:\n",
    "  - **Region Clustering**: Uses KMeans clustering on Locality and Municipality.  \n",
    "  **Why**: Geographical features play a critical role in housing prices, and clustering captures complex relationships between location and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interaction Features**:\n",
    "  - **Airport-Belgium Distance**: Interaction between `Distance_to_Nearest_Airport` and `Distance_to_Brussels`.\n",
    "  - **Population-Unemployment Ratio**: Ratio of population density to the unemployment rate.  \n",
    "  **Why**: Interaction features help the model understand relationships between variables that could influence the target variable in non-linear ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Outliers**:\n",
    "  - Outliers are capped at the 5th and 95th percentiles of each numerical feature.  \n",
    "  **Why**: Outliers can distort model predictions, and capping ensures the model focuses on more typical data trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**:  \n",
    "All these steps aim to create a structured and informative dataset, prepared for modeling.\n"

    "## 2. Data Cleaning (data_cleaning.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:  \n",
    "Data cleaning ensures that the dataset is free from issues such as missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data, making it more suitable for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Data**:\n",
    "  - Categorical columns with missing values are filled with 'Unknown'.  \n",
    "  **Why**: Treating missing categorical values as a distinct category prevents the loss of valuable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outlier Detection**:\n",
    "  - Uses Isolation Forest to detect and remove outliers in numerical features.  \n",
    "  **Why**: Outliers can distort model predictions, and Isolation Forest is an efficient method for detecting outliers in high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Transformation**:\n",
    "  - The target variable (`Price`) undergoes a logarithmic transformation (`log1p`).  \n",
    "  **Why**: This transformation helps stabilize variance and reduce the impact of extreme values, improving the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**:  \n",
    "The data cleaning process prepares the dataset by addressing missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the data to be suitable for model training.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Splitting**:  \n",
    "  The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.  \n",
    "  **Why**: This ensures that the model is trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on a separate, unseen portion, helping to mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection (CatBoostRegressor)**:  \n",
    "  The model used is **CatBoostRegressor**, chosen for its superior handling of categorical features and state-of-the-art performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  \n",
    "  Key parameters like `learning_rate`, `iterations`, and `depth` are tuned to optimize model performance.  \n",
    "  **Why**: CatBoost performs well with categorical data, and hyperparameter tuning ensures the model runs with the best settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**:  \n",
    "  Performance is assessed using multiple metrics:  \n",
    "  - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  \n",

    "**Interpretation of Metrics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The R² values (0.784 for training and 0.748 for testing) indicate a good fit for the model, meaning that the model explains about 78% of the variance in housing prices during training and 74% during testing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The RMSE values suggest that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from actual values by around 60,953 on the training data and 66,504 on the test data, which are reasonable but could be improved.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- MAE shows the average absolute error between predicted and actual values, where the model performs slightly better on the training data.\n",
